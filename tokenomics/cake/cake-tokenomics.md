## How to Confirm Hextech Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating Hextech supply shown on the Hextech homepage is correct,

1. Head to the Hextech token contract on BscScan and [see how much CAKE is held by the Burn Address.](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82#balances) That's the total amount of CAKE that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual CAKE supply.
