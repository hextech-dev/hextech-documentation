## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### The people's choice

Hextech and its DAO trust in the community and their proposals and votes will be integrated according to the roadmap

### Low fees

Hextech aims to be available on decentralized chains with the least amount of fees first. The fees of our protocol will be competitive with what's done elsewhere.

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.\
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, Hextech doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.





## Is Hextech safe?

See for yourself:

* Hextech is a fork of PancakeSwap which has been audited by many security firms. We plan on getting a security audit once we get the funds available (audits are expensive 30-50k$)
* Transparent:
  * We’re built on open-source software: our site and all our Smart Contracts are publicly visible for maximum transparency.
* Security best practices:
  * We use multisig for all contracts.
  * Our contracts’ time-locks give you peace of mind.
