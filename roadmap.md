# Roadmap

Updated Oct. 13, 2021

Crypto moves fast, and we move fast too.

Pivoting is a way of life.

That means that we don’t publicly commit to specific timelines, so we can organize our development priorities based on market changes and developer resources.

For now we're listening exclusively on community proposals that's why it's so important to vote.

Items in the Backlog/exploration phase have not been forgotten, they’re just lower priority in the immediate future than those in the other phases.
{% endhint %}
